# rps-retry
This was my second try at making a rock, paper, scissors game with the user against the computer in JS. My goal with this project was to get some experience using conditionals and a bit of loops.

This project is part of the odin project curriculum and I followed their guidelines, but didn't read far enough into the project to see the logic I was going to need after creating the initial round, so I had too many problems with the first attempt and decided it would be faster to just restart.

Overall I am happy with getting it working, but there are still a lot of improvements that could be made like adding a user interface, which I plan to do in the near future. Completing this has shown me that I am improving my knowledge, and many of my problems in this project simply came down to a lack of knowledge regarding syntax, and I could definitely learn more about function parameters.
